# Simple Elements

This is a collection of elements from the example overlays, so that you can add them to existing scenes in your streaming software if you already have them. Like other overlays, just drag the html file into OBS.

> [!NOTE]
> These all use absolute sizing, so if you have any weird cropping, update the properties of the source with the width and height for the respective layout from the list below.
